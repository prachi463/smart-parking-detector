## 🎓 What Does This Do? (In Simple Terms)

Imagine you're managing a parking lot and need to know:
- ✅ How many parking spaces are empty right now?
- ✅ Which specific spots are available?
- ✅ How full is the parking lot over time?

**This system does exactly that - automatically!**

You provide an image or video of your parking lot, and the system:
1. Lets you mark where the parking spaces are (just click and drag)
2. Uses AI to detect cars in those spaces
3. Shows you which spaces are empty (green) and occupied (red)
4. Generates detailed reports with charts and statistics

**No manual counting needed!** The computer does all the work.

### Real-World Example

```
Input:  Picture of parking lot with 50 spaces
Output: "35 spaces occupied, 15 available"
        + Visual map showing which spots are free
        + Detailed report with charts
        + CSV file for data analysis
```

## 📖 Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Complete Beginner's Guide

This tutorial assumes you've never used the system before. Follow these steps exactly:

#### Step 1: Installation (5 minutes)

```bash
# Open your terminal/command prompt

# Navigate to where you want to save the project
cd Desktop  # or any folder you prefer

# Download the project
git clone https://github.com/8harath/Car-Parking-Detection.git

# Enter the project folder
cd Car-Parking-Detection

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What just happened?** You downloaded the code and installed all the Python libraries it needs.

#### Step 2: Run the Application (1 minute)

```bash
# Start the program
python run.py --image carParkImg.jpg
```

**What you'll see:** A window will open showing a parking lot image.

#### Step 3: Mark Parking Spaces (3 minutes)

This is the most important step! You need to tell the computer where the parking spaces are.

**How to mark spaces:**

1. **Click and hold** your left mouse button at the **top-left** corner of a parking space
2. **Drag** to the **bottom-right** corner of that space
3. **Release** the mouse button
4. You'll see a grid of purple rectangles appear - these are your marked spaces!

**Tips:**
- You can mark multiple spaces at once by dragging over them
- If you make a mistake, **right-click** on a space to remove it
- Press `Z` to undo your last selection
- Press `R` to start over completely

**Practice:** Try marking 5-10 spaces to get the hang of it.

#### Step 4: Save Your Layout (10 seconds)

```
Press 'S' on your keyboard
```

**What happened?** The computer saved your parking space positions. You won't have to mark them again!

#### Step 5: Detect Vehicles (30 seconds)

```
Press 'D' on your keyboard
```

**What happens:**
1. The screen will show: "🚗 Detecting vehicles..."
2. The AI will analyze each parking space
3. Green spaces = Empty
4. Red spaces = Occupied
5. Reports are generated automatically

#### Step 6: View Your Results (2 minutes)

The program creates several files for you:

**1. Visual Report** (`reports/parking_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`)
   - Open this image to see charts and statistics
   - Shows a colorful dashboard with graphs

**2. Text Report** (`reports/parking_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`)
   - Open with any text editor
   - Contains detailed numbers and percentages

**3. CSV Data** (`data/parking_status.csv`)
   - Open with Excel or Google Sheets
   - Great for tracking over time

#### Step 7: Understanding the Output

When you look at the visual report, you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Parking Lot Image (with colors)        │
│  Green = Empty  |  Red = Occupied       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Bar Chart: Parking Statistics          │
│  Shows total, occupied, available       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Pie Charts: Space Distribution         │
│  Regular vs. Special parking            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The text report tells you:
- Total number of parking spaces
- How many are occupied
- How many are available
- Occupancy percentage
- Timestamp of detection

### Common First-Time Questions

**Q: "Do I need to mark spaces every time I run it?"**
A: No! Once you press `S` to save, the spaces are remembered. Next time just press `D` to detect.

**Q: "Can I use my own parking lot image?"**
A: Yes! Just use: `python run.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg`

**Q: "What if I mark the wrong spot?"**
A: Right-click on it to remove, or press `Z` to undo, or press `R` to reset everything.

**Q: "How accurate is the detection?"**
A: The AI (YOLOv8) is about 90-95% accurate. You can adjust sensitivity in `config.py`.

**Q: "Can this work with a video?"**
A: Yes! Use: `python run.py --video your_video.mp4`

**Q: "Where are my reports saved?"**
A: In the `reports/` folder inside the project directory.

### Next Steps After Tutorial

Once you're comfortable with the basics, try:

1. **Use your own images** - Take a photo of any parking lot
2. **Adjust thresholds** - Edit `config.py` to fine-tune detection
3. **Try video mode** - Process a video of a parking lot over time
4. **Analyze patterns** - Open the CSV in Excel to see trends
5. **Modify the code** - Add your own features!

detector.process_image()

# Or process video
detector.process_video()
```

#### Custom Thresholds

Edit `config.py`:

```python
# Adjust detection sensitivity
OCCUPANCY_THRESHOLD = 900  # Lower = more sensitive
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # YOLOv8 confidence (0-1)

# Adjust parking space dimensions
PARKING_WIDTH = 107
PARKING_HEIGHT = 48
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is centralized in `config.py`:

### Key Settings

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `PARKING_WIDTH` | 107 | Parking space width in pixels |
| `PARKING_HEIGHT` | 48 | Parking space height in pixels |
| `OCCUPANCY_THRESHOLD` | 900 | Pixel count threshold for occupancy |
| `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | 0.5 | YOLOv8 detection confidence |
| `MODEL_PATH` | 'yolov8n.pt' | Path to YOLO model |
| `CSV_APPEND_MODE` | True | Append to CSV vs. overwrite |

### Directory Structure

The system automatically creates:

```
reports/       # Generated reports

```

### Detection Pipeline

1. **Pre-processing**
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Gaussian blur (noise reduction)
   - Adaptive thresholding
   - Median blur
   - Morphological operations (dilation)

2. **Vehicle Detection**
   - YOLOv8 inference on full image
   - Filter for vehicle classes (car, truck, bus, motorcycle)
   - Apply confidence threshold
   - Match detections to parking spaces

3. **Occupancy Analysis**
   - Extract each parking space region
   - Count non-zero pixels
   - Compare against threshold
   - Mark as occupied/empty

4. **Special Parking Detection**
   - Convert to HSV color space
   - Detect yellow markings
   - Identify horizontal/vertical lines
   - Mark as special parking space

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'"

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

#### "YOLOv8 model not found"

The model will download automatically on first run. Ensure internet connection.

#### "CUDA out of memory"

```python
# In config.py, use CPU instead of GPU
# Or reduce image resolution
```

#### "No parking spaces detected"

Press `R` to reset and redraw parking spaces. Make sure to press `S` to save.
